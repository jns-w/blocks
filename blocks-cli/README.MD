# Blocks App


### Purpose:
    
Take back control of your time by being keenly aware of how you are using it, and creating blocks of deep focus.

In the current era of hyperactive connectivity, it is easy to be stuck in a loop of shallow activities. Finding time 
to allow your mind to enter a deep state becomes a herculean task.

The Blocks app aim to help alleviate that struggle, and make it as painless as possible to transit into flow state 
daily.


### Problem:

What makes it so hard to focus?
